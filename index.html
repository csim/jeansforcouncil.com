					<p>
						You, the people of Snoqualmie, are my neighbors, and I want to continue to
						serve you on our City Council. I will impartially consider all new legislative
						matters, including the budget, which comes before our Council. I will
						continue to commit an extraordinary amount of focused time and energy to
						participate in the city that serves you. More than anything, I will listen to
						you, the mayor, fellow council members, staff, business owners, and others
						before making decisions. For the greater good of Snoqualmie, I will work
						with federal, state, and county officials as appropriate, as well as our other
						close neighbors from North Bend, the Snoqualmie Tribe, School District,
						Northwest Railway Museum, and more. My passion is this city where my
						wife and I, our children and grandchildren and you have chosen to live,
						work, play and worship. We can make the present and future better together.
